# Team Builder

## Description

The purpose of this project is to help hackers find teammates who are interested in the same kinda project as they are. To help making temas for HackRU easier.
## Inspiration

The mind of Sam Azouzi

Also the awkward team-building events that we've run at hackathons.

## Installation Guide

You need python, pip, and virtualenv. Please use google to get these on your system.
Here are the shell commands that'll complete the installation. Note that you also need SQLite.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HackRU/teamRU.git
cd teamRU
virtualenv venv # or your system-specific version (it'll look similar)
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Example Uses

All solo Hackers looking for a partner or team will use this to help make it easier for them to find teammates with common or just cool ideas.
